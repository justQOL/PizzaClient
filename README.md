# PizzaClient

New:
added vertical to hclip (/hclip [distance] [y offset])
added no args to vclip (tps you to the next lowest block that u can stand on), membership only for now
added gui blur opacity (makes the background darker)
completely reworked outline and glow esp, they don't suck anymore

Bug Fixes:
fixed pizza window icon sometimes crashing and a few other bugs with it
fixed crop aura crash
fixed grappling hook not working w antikb
added /pizza reload command to reload your custom name and membership access (useful if u just bought member/name or changed custom name and don't wanna relog)
made ghost pickaxe only work in dungeons (the thing that creates ghost blocks when right clicking w pickaxe)
fixed powder macro not saving in config
fixed some letters crashing
made all rotations smoother (this might've caused some rotations to be too fast/slow, if you have any lmk and i'll fix)
fixed neu names breaking jerry chine vertical
